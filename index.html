    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p> Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) was a pioneering English mathematician and writer, widely recognized as the first computer programmer. She is best known for her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, which included an algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers. Her work on the Analytical Engine was based on her understanding of its potential to go beyond calculation and perform tasks such as composing music and generating graphics. She died at the age of 36 of cancer in 1852, but her legacy has continued to inspire generations of scientists and mathematicians. Ada Lovelace Day is celebrated annually to honor her contributions.
